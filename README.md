Project 3 - Clowning Around
==============================

This is the README documentation for Slow to React's project 3.  
We saw a desperate need for the clown community to get together and share knowledge without prejudice. Thus Clowning Around was born. So please stop by and hang out. You might just learn a new joke. [This](https://clowning-around-client.onrender.com/) is the best place to Clown Around.
